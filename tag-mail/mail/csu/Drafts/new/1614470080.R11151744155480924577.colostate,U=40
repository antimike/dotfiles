Bill---

Thank you.  It is pretty amazing how well such a simple model agrees
with experimental data, though I imagine it works less well for
transition metals with more complicated electronic structures.

One of the main ways in which the data differs from the idealized
version is that the "oscillator strengths" f_j clearly do not obey the
sum rule in Jackson, suggesting some thermal
detuning factor (as you pointed out).  Is there 

the dominant
collective modes among nearest-neighbor electrons (or something similar)
rather than individual electronic modes.

I think to some degree the vibrations are included phenomenological in the Lorentz Drude model as the damping coeffs gammai which give broadening of the absorption peaks.  In this case I think it is dephasing of the oscillating dipoles due to thermal vibrations that leads to the broadening in solids.  In metals it could also be thermal motions of electrons.  The constants given in the paper are just a fit to the experimental data available at the time.  But they indicate the location of some bound states in the metal.
