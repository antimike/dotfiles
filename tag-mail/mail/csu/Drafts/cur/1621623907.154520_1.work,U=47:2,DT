we are all keen to do what is best with imperfect information and insight. =

Marty asked to participate in that meeting, but I could meet with him separ=

Thanks for sending this along. For the record, I think Marty's correct in h=
is<br>
<br>
assessment---I should be looking at taking time off after finishing my MS<b=

<br>
thesis. Also for the record, it appears that Hua Chen chose to convert my<b=

grade in CMT to a 'C' rather than an 'F'.<br>

<br>
1 pm on Friday works fine for me, assuming it still does for you.<br>
