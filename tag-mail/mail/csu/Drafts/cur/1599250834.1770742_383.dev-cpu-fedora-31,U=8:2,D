    <p>Hi Marty--</p>
    <p>I promised you a written update yesterday.&nbsp; Here it is:</p>
    <p>For the past two weeks or so, as you know, I've been out of
      touch.&nbsp; There are several reasons for this, including the family
      situation I've alluded to, but the most important one is an
      ongoing personal struggle with depression.&nbsp; Normally I wouldn't
      feel the need to be so specific, but I think I owe you a more
      concrete explanation for my behavior at this point.</p>
