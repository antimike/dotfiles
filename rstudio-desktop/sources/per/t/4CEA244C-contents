01/23/2020: Dark Matter (DM) Talkn (Berger)

- Background:
	- DM is known to exist from galactic rotation curves compared to luminosity
	- ``Sound spectrum'' in early universe: cf. graph of ``angular mode ell'' vs. power ell(ell + 1)C_ell / (2\pi)
	
- Boosted DM
	- (i.e., ``fast'' DM)
	- Envisions ``two-component'' DM model
		- Massive, WIMPy \psi
		- Smaller, faster, slightly-stronger-interacting \chi
		- \psi - \psi interactions can lead to \chi production
	- High-\psi concentrations: 
		- Sun: gravitational capture via inelastic collisions with nuclei over long lifetime
		- Detector looks for \chi interactions, mediated by a ``Z prime''
	- ~100 MeV energies (potentially): easily detected (as opposed to conventional ``slow'' DM)
		- Multihadron (i.e., inelastic) scattering can occur at higher eneriges
	- Detection strategies:
		- Cherenkov detectors
			- Threshold: ~480 MeV
			- Difficult to reconstruct inelastic collisions
		- Requires accurate simulation techniques
			- Speaker's work: based on neutron scattering simulations
				- e.g., \chi + \chi \to (via Z') [p, n] + X is analagous to \nu + \nu \to (via Z) [p, n] + X
	- Future work:
		- Resonant scattering (intermediate inelastic scattering)
		- Further models: inelastic BDM (i.e., multicomponent DM)
		- Other sources: galactic center, cosmic rays, etc.
	
- Higgs portal mediators
	- Unstable particles that couple to both Higgs and ``dark sector'' particles
	- Specifically:
		- Dark scalar S mixes with higgs H
			--> Inherits interaction structure but much smaller strength
		- Two key parameters: m_S and \theta_S (mixing angle)
		- High intensity at small mixing angle
	- Potentially produced in K meson decay
		* Ques: K backgrounds / cross sections are extremely well-studied
	- Other ``portal'' models:
		- Sterile neutrino / dark photon
		- In general, any neutral particle in the Standard Model
		
- Macroscopic DM
	- Idea: DM composite structure with potential to generate multiple interactions in detector
	- e.g.: Non-topological soliton
		- ``Lump'' of scalar field \phi
		- Large scalar charge Q --> stable buildup of scalar field
		- DM would then consist of ``balls'' or ``lumps'' of the field \phi
		- Some scenarios: M ~ 1 gram, R ~ .1 \A
	- Macroscopic DM could form bound states analagous to neutron capture in nuclei
		- Each capture event would generate ``splashes'' of 10 - 100 MeV photons
	- Calculations:
		- Want cross-sections for kR >> \hbar (high energy) and ER >> \hbar c (non-dipole)
			--> Gives elastic scattering

- Standard detection strategy:
	- Observe small momentum transfers to nuclei at very non-relativistic velocities (1e-3 c)
