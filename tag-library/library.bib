@book{sellerifrancoQuantumParadoxesPhysical,
  annote = {Although the debate about the true nature of the quantum behavior of atomic systems has never ceased, there are two periods during which it has been particularly intense: the years that saw the founding of quantum mechanics and, increasingly, these modern times. In 1954 Max Born, on accepting the Nobel Prize for his 'fundamental researches in quantum mechanics', recalled the depth of the disagreements that divided celebrated quantum theorists of those days into two camps: . . . when I say that physicists had accepted the way of thinking developed by us at that time, r am not quite correct: there are a few most noteworthy exceptions - namely, among those very workers who have contributed most to the building up of quantum theory. Planck himself belonged to the sceptics until his death. Einstein, de Broglie, and Schriidinger have not ceased to emphasize the unsatisfactory features of quantum mechanics . . . . This dramatic disagreement centered around some of the most funda\- mental questions in all of science: Do atomic objects exist il1dependently of human observations and, if so, is it possible for man to understand correctly their behavior? By and large, it can be said that the Copenhagen and Gottingen schools - led by Bohr, Heisenberg, and Born, in particular- gave more or less openly pessimistic answers to these questions.},

This unique book on statistical physics offers an advanced approach with numerous applications to the modern problems students are confronted with. Therefore the text contains more concepts and methods in statistics than the student would need for statistical mechanics alone. Methods from mathematical statistics and stochastics for the analysis of data are discussed as well.
The book is divided into two parts, focusing first on the modeling of statistical systems and then on the analysis of these systems. Problems with hints for solution help the students to deepen their knowledge. The third edition has been updated and enlarged with new sections deepening the knowledge about data analysis. Moreover, a customized set of problems with solutions is accessible on the Web at extras.springer.com.},

@book{mikhailovalexanderFoundationsSynergetics1990,
  annote = {This book gives an introduction to the mathematical theory of cooperative behavior in active systems of various origins, both natural and artificial. It is based on a lecture course in synergetics which I held for almost ten years at the University of Moscow. The first volume deals mainly with the problems of pattern fonnation and the properties of self-organized regular patterns in distributed active systems. It also contains a discussion of distributed analog information processing which is based on the cooperative dynamics of active systems. The second volume is devoted to the stochastic aspects of self-organization and the properties of self-established chaos. I have tried to avoid delving into particular applications. The primary intention is to present general mathematical models that describe the principal kinds of coopera\- tive behavior in distributed active systems. Simple examples, ranging from chemical physics to economics, serve only as illustrations of the typical context in which a particular model can apply. The manner of exposition is more in the tradition of theoretical physics than of in mathematics: Elaborate fonnal proofs and rigorous estimates are often replaced the text by arguments based on an intuitive understanding of the relevant models. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of this book, its readers might well come from very diverse fields of endeavor. It was therefore desirable to minimize the re\-quired preliminary knowledge. Generally, a standard university course in differential calculus and linear algebra is sufficient.},

@book{fanchijohnr.ParameterizedRelativisticQuantum1993,
  annote = {Over the past five decades researchers have sought to develop a new framework that would resolve the anomalies attributable to a patchwork formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics. This book chronicles the development of a new paradigm for describing relativistic quantum phenomena. What makes the new paradigm unique is its inclusion of a physically measurable, invariant evolution parameter. The resulting theory has been sufficiently well developed in the refereed literature that it is now possible to present a synthesis of its ideas and techniques. My synthesis is intended to encourage and enhance future research, and is presented in six parts. The environment within which the conventional paradigm exists is described in the Introduction. Part I eases the mainstream reader into the ideas of the new paradigm by providing the reader with a discussion that should look very familiar, but contains subtle nuances. Indeed, I try to provide the mainstream reader with familiar "landmarks" throughout the text. This is possible because the new paradigm contains the conventional paradigm as a subset. The foundation of the new paradigm is presented in Part II, fol!owed by numerous applications in the remaining three parts. The reader should notice that the new paradigm handles not only the broad class of problems typically dealt with in conventional relativistic quantum theory, but also contains fertile research areas for both experimentalists and theorists. To avoid developing a theoretical framework without physical validity, numerous comparisons between theory and experiment are provided, and several predictions are made.},

@book{ArrowsTime2012,
  annote = {The concept of time has fascinated humanity throughout recorded history, and it remains one of the biggest mysteries in science and philosophy. Time is clearly one of the fundamental building blocks of the universe and thus a deeper understanding of nature at a fundamental level also demands a comprehension of time. Furthermore, the origins of the universe are closely intertwined with the puzzle of time: Did time emerge at the Big Bang? Why does the arrow of time `conspire' with the order of the initial state of the universe?
This book addresses many of the most important questions about time: What is time, and is it fundamental or emergent? Why is there such an arrow of time, closely related to the initial state of the universe, and why do the cosmic, thermodynamic and other arrows agree? These issues are discussed here by leading experts, and each offers a new perspective on the debate. Their contributions delve into the most difficult research topic in physics, also describing the latest cutting edge research on the subject. The book also offers readers a comparison between the different outlooks of philosophy, physics and cosmology on the puzzle of time.
This volume is intended to be useful for research purposes, but most chapters are also accessible to a more general audience of scientifically educated readers looking for deeper insights.},

@book{sellerifrancoQuantumParadoxesPhysical,
  annote = {Although the debate about the true nature of the quantum behavior of atomic systems has never ceased, there are two periods during which it has been particularly intense: the years that saw the founding of quantum mechanics and, increasingly, these modern times. In 1954 Max Born, on accepting the Nobel Prize for his 'fundamental researches in quantum mechanics', recalled the depth of the disagreements that divided celebrated quantum theorists of those days into two camps: . . . when I say that physicists had accepted the way of thinking developed by us at that time, r am not quite correct: there are a few most noteworthy exceptions - namely, among those very workers who have contributed most to the building up of quantum theory. Planck himself belonged to the sceptics until his death. Einstein, de Broglie, and Schriidinger have not ceased to emphasize the unsatisfactory features of quantum mechanics . . . . This dramatic disagreement centered around some of the most funda\- mental questions in all of science: Do atomic objects exist il1dependently of human observations and, if so, is it possible for man to understand correctly their behavior? By and large, it can be said that the Copenhagen and Gottingen schools - led by Bohr, Heisenberg, and Born, in particular- gave more or less openly pessimistic answers to these questions.},

  annote = {Over the past five decades researchers have sought to develop a new framework that would resolve the anomalies attributable to a patchwork formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics. This book chronicles the development of a new paradigm for describing relativistic quantum phenomena. What makes the new paradigm unique is its inclusion of a physically measurable, invariant evolution parameter. The resulting theory has been sufficiently well developed in the refereed literature that it is now possible to present a synthesis of its ideas and techniques. My synthesis is intended to encourage and enhance future research, and is presented in six parts. The environment within which the conventional paradigm exists is described in the Introduction. Part I eases the mainstream reader into the ideas of the new paradigm by providing the reader with a discussion that should look very familiar, but contains subtle nuances. Indeed, I try to provide the mainstream reader with familiar "landmarks" throughout the text. This is possible because the new paradigm contains the conventional paradigm as a subset. The foundation of the new paradigm is presented in Part II, fol!owed by numerous applications in the remaining three parts. The reader should notice that the new paradigm handles not only the broad class of problems typically dealt with in conventional relativistic quantum theory, but also contains fertile research areas for both experimentalists and theorists. To avoid developing a theoretical framework without physical validity, numerous comparisons between theory and experiment are provided, and several predictions are made.},

@book{mikhailovalexanderFoundationsSynergetics1990,
  annote = {This book gives an introduction to the mathematical theory of cooperative behavior in active systems of various origins, both natural and artificial. It is based on a lecture course in synergetics which I held for almost ten years at the University of Moscow. The first volume deals mainly with the problems of pattern fonnation and the properties of self-organized regular patterns in distributed active systems. It also contains a discussion of distributed analog information processing which is based on the cooperative dynamics of active systems. The second volume is devoted to the stochastic aspects of self-organization and the properties of self-established chaos. I have tried to avoid delving into particular applications. The primary intention is to present general mathematical models that describe the principal kinds of coopera\- tive behavior in distributed active systems. Simple examples, ranging from chemical physics to economics, serve only as illustrations of the typical context in which a particular model can apply. The manner of exposition is more in the tradition of theoretical physics than of in mathematics: Elaborate fonnal proofs and rigorous estimates are often replaced the text by arguments based on an intuitive understanding of the relevant models. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of this book, its readers might well come from very diverse fields of endeavor. It was therefore desirable to minimize the re\-quired preliminary knowledge. Generally, a standard university course in differential calculus and linear algebra is sufficient.},

@book{ArrowsTime2012,
  annote = {The concept of time has fascinated humanity throughout recorded history, and it remains one of the biggest mysteries in science and philosophy. Time is clearly one of the fundamental building blocks of the universe and thus a deeper understanding of nature at a fundamental level also demands a comprehension of time. Furthermore, the origins of the universe are closely intertwined with the puzzle of time: Did time emerge at the Big Bang? Why does the arrow of time `conspire' with the order of the initial state of the universe?
This book addresses many of the most important questions about time: What is time, and is it fundamental or emergent? Why is there such an arrow of time, closely related to the initial state of the universe, and why do the cosmic, thermodynamic and other arrows agree? These issues are discussed here by leading experts, and each offers a new perspective on the debate. Their contributions delve into the most difficult research topic in physics, also describing the latest cutting edge research on the subject. The book also offers readers a comparison between the different outlooks of philosophy, physics and cosmology on the puzzle of time.
This volume is intended to be useful for research purposes, but most chapters are also accessible to a more general audience of scientifically educated readers looking for deeper insights.},

  annote = {The application of statistical methods to physics is essential. This unique book on statistical physics offers an advanced approach with numerous applications to the modern problems students are confronted with. Therefore the text contains more concepts and methods in statistics than the student would need for statistical mechanics alone. Methods from mathematical statistics and stochastics for the analysis of data are discussed as well.
The book is divided into two parts, focusing first on the modeling of statistical systems and then on the analysis of these systems. Problems with hints for solution help the students to deepen their knowledge. The third edition has been updated and enlarged with new sections deepening the knowledge about data analysis. Moreover, a customized set of problems with solutions is accessible on the Web at extras.springer.com.},
